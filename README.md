## Features

- **Video Upload**: Upload videos of your basketball shot from your device or drag and drop
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses TensorFlow.js and PoseNet to analyze body positioning and movement
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive instant analysis of your shooting form
- **Visual Representation**: See visual overlay of your form with key points highlighted
- **Personalized Tips**: Get customized recommendations to improve your technique

## Key Metrics Analyzed

The Shot Form Analyzer evaluates several key aspects of your shooting form:

1. **Elbow Angle**: Measures the angle of your shooting arm's elbow to ensure optimal form (ideally around 90Â°)
2. **Release Point**: Analyzes the timing of your ball release relative to your jump
3. **Knee Bend**: Evaluates the depth of your knee bend for proper power generation
4. **Balance & Alignment**: Assesses your vertical alignment for stability and consistency

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Computer Vision**: TensorFlow.js and PoseNet for pose estimation
- **Media Processing**: HTML5 Canvas API for video frame extraction and visualization

## How It Works

1. The user uploads a short video clip (5-10 seconds) of their basketball shot
2. The application extracts key frames from the video
3. PoseNet analyzes each frame to identify body positioning
4. Custom algorithms evaluate the shooting mechanics against ideal form
5. Results are calculated and displayed with visual feedback and recommendations

## Installation and Usage

The Shot Form Analyzer is a web application that runs entirely in the browser. No installation is required.

To use locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Upload a video of your basketball shot
4. Click "Analyze Shot" to see your results

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxaginfo/basketball-shot-form-analyzer.git
cd basketball-shot-form-analyzer
```

## Privacy and Data Security

All processing is done client-side in your browser. Your videos are never uploaded to any server and remain on your device. The application uses your browser's built-in capabilities to analyze the video without sending any data over the internet.

## Browser Compatibility

The application works best in modern browsers with WebGL support:
- Chrome 69+
- Firefox 62+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Future Enhancements

- Shot trajectory analysis
- Multi-angle comparison
- Shot consistency tracking over time
- Shot improvement progress reports
- Training drills based on analysis results
